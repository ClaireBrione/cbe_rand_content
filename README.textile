h1. cbe_rand_content

A minimalist, but functional admin-side plugin to populate your content tables.

h2. Features

If you need content to test your front-end, this plugin will generate random articles and comments for you. Keywords and custom fields are **not** populated.

One trouble, though: they are written in Martian, with sometimes a very little bit of lorem ipsum. But even on Mars, sentences begin with an uppercase and end with a period, names begin with an uppercase.

Chain articles and their comments generation (already existing articles will be left untouched).
